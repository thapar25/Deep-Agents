# README for Deep Agents

## Project Overview
**Name:** Deep Agents  
**Version:** 0.1.0  
**Description:** A framework for building intelligent agents using deep learning and language models.

## Key Features
- **Integration with Language Models:** Utilizes `ChatOpenAI` for natural language processing tasks.
- **Python REPL Tool:** Allows execution of Python code snippets dynamically.
- **Modular Architecture:** Designed with a focus on extensibility and ease of use.

## Installation Instructions
To install the necessary dependencies, ensure you have Python 3.13 or higher, and run the following command:

```bash
pip install deepagents>=0.0.4 langchain-experimental>=0.3.4 langchain-ollama>=0.3.7 langchain-openai>=0.3.31 langgraph-cli[inmem]>=0.3.8
```

## Usage Examples
Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to use the Deep Agents framework:

```python
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
from langchain_core.tools import tool
from langchain_experimental.utilities import PythonREPL
from deepagents import create_deep_agent

# Initialize the language model
llm = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4o-mini", temperature=0.2)

@tool
def run_python_repl(code: str) -> str:
    """Run Python code in a REPL environment."""
    repl = PythonREPL()
    result = repl.run(code)
    return result

# Example usage of the run_python_repl function
result = run_python_repl("print('Hello, World!')")
print(result)  # Output: Hello, World!
```
