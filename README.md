# Deepâ€‘Agents

## Overview
Deepâ€‘Agents is a minimal starter kit that demonstrates how to build a **deepâ€‘agent** â€“ a LangChainâ€‘powered LLM agent that can execute Python code in a REPL. The repository showcases how to wire an LLM (OpenAI/Ollama) with a custom tool (`run_python_repl`) so that the agent can *walk* through a codebase and answer questions about it.

## Project Structure
```
Deep-Agents/
â”œâ”€â”€ agents/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ readme.py          # Example agent implementation
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md              # This file (to be completed)
â”œâ”€â”€ pyproject.toml         # Dependencies and metadata
â””â”€â”€ ...
```

## Quick Start
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.10+
- An OpenAI API key or Ollama instance running locally.
- Docker (optional, for Ollama).

### Install
```bash
# Create a virtual environment (recommended)
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate   # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -e .
```

### Run the Demo
```bash
python agents/readme.py
```

This script:
1. Instantiates an LLM (`ChatOllama` by default, falling back to `ChatOpenAI`).
2. Registers the `run_python_repl` tool.
3. Creates a `code-walk-agent` that uses the LLM and the tool.
4. Demonstrates a simple question (e.g., "List all Python files in the repo").

## How It Works
### `run_python_repl`
```python
from langchain.tools import tool

@tool
def run_python_repl(tool_input: str) -> str:
    """Executes arbitrary Python code and returns the printed output."""
    import sys, subprocess, tempfile
    ...  # implementation omitted for brevity
```
The agent calls this function to execute code like `import os; os.listdir('.')` and receives the result.

### `code-walk-agent`
The agent is defined in `agents/readme.py` using LangChainâ€™s `create_llm_agent`. Its prompt explains that it can use `run_python_repl` to explore the repository. Because the tool is the only external action, the agent remains deterministic and easy to test.

## Extending the Project
- **Add more tools** (e.g., Git, file read/write) to increase introspection.
- **Create a real agent** that chains the code-walk agent with other LLM calls to answer complex queries.
- **Add tests** to verify tool output and agent behavior.
